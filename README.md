# SolarmakerC2Servers
This is a repository of C2 IP addresses seen in use by Solarmarker.

These IP addresses tend to change weekly, but I am hosting a list of previously seen IP for the sake of documentation. It can also be interesting to visualize them in various ways to determine if there are trends. At this point, I am only providing the IP addresses. Visualization and other aspects are up to you.
